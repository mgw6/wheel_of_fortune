# Wheel of Fortune

A command line version of the "Wheel of Fortune" TV Game. 


I had been thinking about how I wanted to do this for a while, and finally got around to it over Christmas break. 
I originally intended to do it in Python, but  decided to teach myself C++ along the way. 
It was pretty straightforward because I already have experience in C and Java, 
but I am sure this code looks a bit Pythonic and a real C++ dev would have qualms. 

I also am realizing the limitations of doing it in C++. 
I don't have time to learn graphics in C++ like I know them in Python, 
and I can't use ncurses on Windows. 
I will probably rewrite this in Python at some point, but for now I am enjoying learning C++.
